# Niloufar Naseri — Applied Data & Design

This GitHub serves as a curated space for selected technical explorations.

My recent work focuses on:
- Data-driven design and applied research
- Human-centered AI systems
- Ethical and responsible technology

Some projects (including academic and client-based work) are not publicly available due to confidentiality.
I am happy to discuss these projects and share technical details during an interview.

This space will be gradually updated with open experiments and learning projects.
